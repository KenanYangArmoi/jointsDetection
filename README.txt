--Training

	1. input pipline -- input data to models without interrupting - Using queue to do that
	2. model -- 1. Net-Structure 2. loss function 3. optimiser -- minise the loss
	3. main function -- 1. call input, 2. input the data into models, 3, call optimsier to trian model

--Prediction

	--Call the model which has been optimised during training
	--Give the predict results
